# 🔍 JavaScript Promise Visualizer

A beginner-friendly visual tool to understand how JavaScript Promises work under the hood — complete with a clear timeline, live logs, and animations. Perfect for those new to asynchronous JS!

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Promises can be confusing for beginners — `.then`, `.catch`, microtasks vs macrotasks, resolution timing — it's a lot. This visualizer breaks all that down into **simple animations and logging**, helping learners _see_ what happens when a Promise is created, resolved, rejected, or chained.
